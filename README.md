# DrumKit
Created using Html, Css and JavaScript

The Drumkit project aims to create a simple yet interactive web application that allows users to play various drum sounds using their keyboard. This project leverages HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, providing a hands-on approach to learning and implementing web development skills.

Project Structure
The project consists of three main components:

HTML (index.html): Defines the structure and content of the webpage.
CSS (styles.css): Adds styling to the HTML elements, making the webpage visually appealing.
JavaScript (scripts.js): Adds interactivity, enabling the drum sounds to play when specific keys are pressed.
